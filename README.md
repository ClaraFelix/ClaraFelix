# üëã Hi, I'm Clara!

I have 3 years of experience with frontend development, using mainly Angular and Typescript, but I like to explore and delve into new technologies too.

I like to code very faithfully to the proposed layout, supported by good responsiveness, good lighthouse metrics, especially accessibility.

I prioritize writing clean and scalable code, performing unit tests, helping the team with their demands and I have notions of figma and UI/UX.

My main objectives and goals are to improve my English and advance in seniority, always striving for efficiency and quality in my work routine, respect and ethics towards clients and the work team.
