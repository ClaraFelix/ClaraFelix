# üëã Hi, I'm Clara!

Frontend Developer with solid experience in Angular 15+, TypeScript, and API integration, having worked on innovative projects involving Web3 and Artificial Intelligence. During my time at Venture Miner, I actively contributed to creating user journeys, implementing efficient interfaces, and conducting unit tests, always striving for high-quality solutions.

I like to code very faithfully to the proposed layout, supported by good responsiveness, good lighthouse metrics, especially accessibility.

I prioritize writing clean and scalable code, performing unit tests, helping the team with their demands and I have notions of figma and UI/UX.

My main objectives and goals are to improve my English and advance in seniority, always striving for efficiency and quality in my work routine, respect and ethics towards clients and the work team.
